# Psychophysiological Methods in Cognitive Psychology

**A Living Textbook by Dr. Yang and Students, For Everyone**

Dr. Yang, Yu-Fang | Freie Universität Berlin

## What This Is

I started teaching psychophysiological methods in Winter Semester 2021 at Freie Universität Berlin, covering EEG, EOG, EDA, EMG, and ECG. Teaching a topic this broad isn't easy—I couldn't find a single book covering all the methods I wanted to teach. I use several key textbooks (Andreassi, Ward, Cacioppo et al., Stern et al., Luck—see below), but it's overwhelming for students to search through multiple books and scattered references.

Last year (2024), I added Electrogastrography (EGG) because health and wellbeing have become central to psychology—and the gut is our second brain, right? That's when I decided to create this structured resource based on my lectures and the questions students actually ask. Not a textbook written by distant experts, but a **student-centered** resource that reflects real classroom learning.

I'll admit: preparing lectures while building this textbook simultaneously wasn't easy. Figuring out how to encourage students to contribute meaningfully was a challenge. But I'm grateful—last year's students were motivated and contributed beautifully to this journey.

This semester (Winter 2025/26), we just started a month ago when I wrote this part. I decided to make it public online as a living document. It's still a work in progress. Anyone who wants to contribute can, following open science principles: knowledge should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ([FAIR Principles, see Wikinson et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)). We can make this textbook better each time.

**I know it's not perfect.** In the beginning, things are always a bit rough. But I'm happy we started.

I provide the core material, structure, and scientific foundation. Students either: search literature, revise the text, suggest better explanations, find missing references, and/or point out confusing parts. Anyone—researchers, other instructors, curious learners can improve it.

This is messy, honest, and real. That's the point. :)

## Why Open?

**Open Science matters.** Knowledge funded by public universities should be public knowledge. Research methods shouldn't hide behind $200 textbooks. If you want to learn how we measure brain activity, eye movements, muscle signals, or gut activity to study cognition and wellbeing, you should be able to—freely.

I'm inspired by the open science movement: preprints, open data, reproducible research. This textbook follows that philosophy. Share knowledge. Make it accessible. Improve it collectively.

## Who This Is For

**Students in my course** at Freie Universität Berlin—this complements lectures. I reveal chapters after we cover them in class since I'm still refining.

**Master's students anywhere** learning psychophysiological methods.

**Researchers** needing quick methodology references.

**Other instructors** wanting to adapt this for their courses (credit us and share your version openly).

**Anyone curious** about measuring human physiology to understand mind and body. No prerequisites needed.

## How to Use This

**My current students:**
- Read chapters *after* the lecture
- Review what we covered in class
- Check details you missed
- Follow references for deeper reading
- Tell me what's confusing so we can improve it

**Studying for exams:**
- Focus on *why* things work, not just memorizing facts
- Understand principles
- Each chapter notes exam coverage

**Doing research:**
- Jump to methodology sections
- Check practical considerations and pitfalls
- Follow references to original papers

**Teaching elsewhere:**
- Adapt freely (CC BY-SA 4.0 license)
- Credit us and share your version openly
- Tell us what you changed—we learn from you too

## The Six Methods

### 1. [Electroencephalography (EEG)](chapters/eeg.md)
Brain electrical activity from scalp. Millisecond precision for studying cognition.

*Revised by: Lara, Luna, Chiara, Yuhan*

### 2. [Electrooculography (EOG)](chapters/eog.md)  
Eye movement tracking via electrical potentials. Gaze reveals thought.

*Revised by: Mikael Binnewies, Leon Emmerich, Aleks Relic, Katinka Müller, Elisabeth Martens*

### 3. [Electromyography (EMG)](chapters/emg.md)
Muscle electrical activity. Motor control, fatigue, clinical diagnosis.

*Revised by: Ronnie Porterfield, Lara Bellu, Luna Heinrich, Benjamin Meersseman*

### 4. Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
Skin conductance and emotional arousal.

*In development*

### 5. Electrocardiography (ECG)  
Heart activity and autonomic nervous system function.

*In development*

### 6. Electrogastrography (EGG)
Gut electrical activity. The second brain and wellbeing.

*In development*

## Key Textbooks I Use

While this online resource grows, I prepare lectures using these foundational textbooks. Each chapter cites specific sections:

1. **Andreassi, J. L.** (2007). *Psychophysiology: Human Behavior and Physiological Response* (4th ed.). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

2. **Ward, J.** (2020). *The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience* (4th ed.). Routledge/Psychology Press.

3. **Cacioppo, J. T., Tassinary, L. G., & Berntson, G. G.** (Eds.). (2017). *Handbook of Psychophysiology* (4th ed.). Cambridge University Press.

4. **Stern, R. M., Ray, W. J., & Quigley, K. S.** (2001). *Psychophysiological Recording* (2nd ed.). Oxford University Press.

5. **Luck, S. J.** (2014). *An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique* (2nd ed.). MIT Press.

Together, these cover theoretical foundations, recording techniques, and data analysis. But no single book covers all six methods in the way my course does—which is why this textbook exists.

## Why It's Messy

Traditional textbooks pretend to be complete and authoritative. They're written once, published, frozen.
This textbook admits imperfection. Some sections need work. New research will change things. Students will find better explanations than mine.
**That's fine.**  Actually, that's better. Science is messy. Learning is messy. Let's be honest about it.
I'm still refining chapters as I teach. Students catch errors I miss. The textbook improves each semester. Version 1.0 isn't the goal—continuous improvement is. :)

## My Teaching Philosophy

Students learn best as active participants, not passive receivers. When you search references, explain concepts to peers, or question my explanations, you learn more than just reading.

This textbook reflects that. You're not consuming information—you're building the resource.

German technical terms appear [in brackets] when genuinely helpful for students at a German university. Not everywhere, just where needed.


## Academic Integrity

Despite being open and evolving, this is serious scholarship:
- Cites primary research with DOIs
- Follows scientific consensus
- Distinguishes facts from debates  
- Credits all contributors
- Uses proper terminology
