# Electrooculography (EOG)

*Revised by: Mikael Binnewies, Leon Emmerich, Aleks Relic, Katinka Müller, Elisabeth Martens*

## Introduction

Electrooculography (EOG) measures eye movements by detecting voltage changes generated by the corneo-retinal potential. This electrical potential exists because the cornea maintains a positive charge relative to the retina, creating a stable dipole that rotates with eye movement. When electrodes placed near the eyes detect these rotations, researchers can track gaze direction and movement patterns with millisecond precision.

EOG has remained relevant despite advances in video-based eye tracking because it functions in complete darkness (essential for sleep research), integrates seamlessly with EEG recordings, requires minimal equipment, and provides high temporal resolution. The method is particularly valuable for studying REM sleep, reading processes, attentional shifts, and clinical disorders affecting oculomotor control.

## The Corneo-Retinal Potential

### Physiological Basis

The human eye generates a standing electrical potential with the cornea approximately 0.4-1.0 mV positive relative to the retina (Abo-Zahhad et al., 2015). This potential arises from the metabolic activity of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which actively transports ions to maintain the electrical gradient across retinal layers. The RPE performs multiple functions: it absorbs scattered light, supplies nutrients to photoreceptors, and maintains the ionic environment necessary for phototransduction.

The retina contains two types of photoreceptors with distinct distributions and functions. Rods comprise approximately 94% of photoreceptors and are concentrated in peripheral retina, providing high sensitivity to low light levels but no color discrimination. Cones comprise 6% of photoreceptors and concentrate in the fovea, enabling high-acuity color vision in central vision. This distribution explains why peripheral vision detects motion effectively but cannot resolve fine detail.

Multiple retinal layers perform preprocessing before signals reach the brain, including edge detection, motion detection, and light adaptation. This preprocessing reduces the computational burden on cortical visual areas and enables rapid responses to visual stimuli.

### Factors Affecting Potential Magnitude

Several factors modulate the corneo-retinal potential. Light adaptation increases potential magnitude because photoreceptor activity enhances RPE metabolic activity. Conversely, dark adaptation reduces potential strength. Fatigue decreases signal amplitude over extended recording sessions. Eye moisture affects signal quality, with dry eyes producing increased noise. Age-related changes reduce potential magnitude in older adults. These factors require careful experimental control and periodic calibration during extended recordings.

## Recording Methodology

### Electrode Placement

EOG requires differential recording between electrode pairs. For horizontal eye movements (HEOG), electrodes are placed at the left and right lateral canthi (outer eye corners). The signal represents voltage at the left electrode minus voltage at the right electrode. Rightward eye movements produce positive deflections; leftward movements produce negative deflections.

For vertical eye movements (VEOG), electrodes are placed supra-orbitally (on the eyebrow) and infra-orbitally (on the cheekbone below the eye). The signal represents voltage above minus voltage below. Upward eye movements produce positive deflections; downward movements and blinks produce negative deflections. A reference electrode is typically placed on the mastoid or forehead to provide a common reference point (López et al., 2016).

The measurement range extends to approximately ±70° horizontally and ±30° vertically, though optimal linearity occurs within ±30° horizontally and ±20° vertically. Beyond these ranges, the relationship between voltage and eye position becomes nonlinear.

### Calibration

EOG measures voltage in microvolts, but researchers need eye position in degrees of visual angle. Calibration establishes the mathematical relationship between these measures. A standard five-point calibration presents fixation targets at known positions: center (0°, 0°), left (-10°, 0°), right (+10°, 0°), up (0°, +10°), and down (0°, -10°).

Participants fixate each target while voltage is recorded. Linear regression calculates conversion factors: horizontal voltage to horizontal position and vertical voltage to vertical position. These calibration functions are then applied to all subsequent data. Individual differences in corneo-retinal potential magnitude, eye anatomy, and electrode placement necessitate individual calibration for each participant and session.

### Signal Processing

Raw EOG signals contain multiple components requiring processing. Eye movements constitute the signal of interest. Blinks produce large-amplitude artifacts requiring detection and removal. Electrical noise at 50 or 60 Hz from power lines requires notch filtering. Muscle artifacts from facial movements contaminate recordings. Baseline drift occurs over time due to electrode polarization and changes in skin conductance.

A standard processing pipeline applies multiple stages. High-pass filtering (0.1 Hz) removes slow baseline drift. Low-pass filtering (30 Hz) attenuates high-frequency noise and muscle activity. Notch filtering removes power line interference. Blink detection identifies characteristic large-amplitude deflections in vertical channels. Blinks are either removed from analysis or interpolated using surrounding data. Artifact rejection removes segments with excessive noise. Finally, calibration functions convert voltage to degrees of visual angle.

## Types of Eye Movements

### Saccades

Saccades are rapid, ballistic eye movements that redirect gaze between fixation points. They are the fastest movements humans produce, reaching velocities up to 900°/second. Saccades serve to bring objects of interest onto the fovea for detailed examination. Once initiated, saccades cannot be modified mid-flight—they follow a predetermined trajectory based on the initial motor command.

Saccade latency (the time from target appearance to movement onset) typically ranges from 150-250 ms. This interval reflects visual processing time, target selection, and motor programming. Reaction time paradigms use saccade latency to measure processing speed in various populations.

During saccades, visual perception is suppressed—a phenomenon called saccadic suppression. This prevents perception of motion blur as the eyes move rapidly across the visual field. The brain predicts the consequences of the eye movement and suppresses visual input during the movement itself.

### Fixations

Fixations are periods of relative eye stability lasting 200-300 ms during which visual information is acquired. However, the eyes are never truly still during fixation. Three types of fixational eye movements occur: tremor (aperiodic oscillations at 30-100 Hz with amplitude <0.1°), drift (slow, meandering movements at 0.5-2°/second), and microsaccades (small saccades of 0.5-2° amplitude occurring 1-3 times per second).

Fixational eye movements serve important functions. They prevent Troxler fading, which occurs when a stationary image on the retina gradually disappears from perception. By continuously shifting the retinal image, fixational movements refresh photoreceptor responses. Recent research suggests microsaccades may also reflect covert attention shifts, with microsaccade direction predicting where spatial attention is directed (Martinez-Conde et al., 2004; Rucci & Victor, 2015).

### Smooth Pursuit

Smooth pursuit movements track moving objects, maintaining their image on the fovea. Unlike saccades, smooth pursuit is continuous and velocity-matched to target motion. Maximum smooth pursuit velocity is approximately 30-50°/second. Pursuit movements cannot be generated voluntarily without a moving target—attempting to smoothly move the eyes across a stationary scene produces saccades instead.

Smooth pursuit requires continuous visual feedback. The system compares retinal slip (the difference between target velocity and eye velocity) and generates motor commands to minimize this error. Pursuit latency is approximately 100 ms, shorter than saccadic latency because pursuit uses different neural pathways requiring less complex computations.

### Vergence Movements

Vergence movements adjust the convergence angle between the two eyes when viewing objects at different depths. Convergence occurs when both eyes rotate inward to fixate near objects. Divergence occurs when both eyes rotate outward to fixate distant objects. Vergence movements are relatively slow (maximum 20-30°/second) and driven by binocular disparity signals indicating depth.

Vergence movements differ fundamentally from other eye movements because they are disconjugate—the two eyes move in opposite directions rather than together. The vergence system coordinates with accommodation (lens focusing) and pupil constriction in the near triad response.

### Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex

The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes gaze during head movements. When the head rotates, the VOR generates compensatory eye movements in the opposite direction with nearly equal velocity. This reflex is extremely rapid (latency 10-15 ms) because it bypasses cortical processing, using direct pathways from vestibular organs to oculomotor nuclei.

The VOR can be measured using EOG by recording eye movements during head rotation in darkness (where visual feedback is absent). VOR gain (eye velocity / head velocity) is normally close to 1.0, indicating perfect compensation. Reduced VOR gain indicates vestibular dysfunction.

## Comparison: EOG versus Video-Based Eye Tracking

### Methodological Differences

Video-based eye tracking uses infrared illumination to image the eye. The system tracks the pupil center and the corneal reflection (first Purkinje image) generated by an infrared light source. The vector from pupil center to corneal reflection indicates gaze direction. Calibration maps this vector to screen coordinates.

Two main types exist. Remote eye trackers are mounted on monitors or desks, allowing free head movement within a defined range. Head-mounted eye trackers are worn like glasses, moving with the participant to maintain constant eye-camera geometry.

### Comparative Advantages

EOG provides several advantages in specific contexts. It functions in complete darkness, essential for sleep research where light would alter sleep stages. Setup is simple, requiring only electrode placement rather than camera positioning and lighting adjustment. Cost is minimal compared to commercial eye trackers. Integration with EEG is straightforward because both use similar amplification and recording systems. EOG tolerates head movement better than remote eye trackers.

Video-based eye tracking excels in other contexts. Spatial resolution is superior, typically achieving 0.1-0.5° accuracy compared to EOG's 1-2° accuracy. Torsional eye movements (rotation around the viewing axis) can be measured using pupil shape analysis, which EOG cannot detect. Blink detection is more reliable using video. Pupil diameter can be measured simultaneously, providing an index of arousal and cognitive load. Modern systems offer minimal obtrusiveness with head-mounted options.

## Applications in Psychology and Medicine

### Sleep Research

REM sleep identification relies on EOG. During REM sleep, rapid eye movements occur in bursts while muscle tone reaches its minimum (detected by EMG). Stage 1 sleep shows slow, rolling eye movements. Stages 2-4 (non-REM sleep) show minimal or absent eye movements. EOG amplitude reflects eye movement intensity, and frequency distinguishes between sleep stages.

Sleep disorders produce characteristic EOG patterns. Narcolepsy patients enter REM sleep abnormally quickly. REM behavior disorder shows normal REM-associated eye movements but abnormal muscle tone. Sleep onset REM periods indicate disrupted sleep architecture.

### Reading Research

Reading produces stereotyped eye movement patterns. Fixations last 200-250 ms on average, during which 7-9 characters are processed in the foveal region and 3-4 characters in the parafoveal region. Saccades move the eyes forward 7-9 character spaces on average, though saccade length varies with word length, word frequency, and text difficulty.

Regressions (backward saccades) occur approximately 10-15% of the time, indicating processing difficulty or disambiguation. Skilled readers make fewer and shorter fixations, longer forward saccades, and fewer regressions compared to less skilled readers.

EOG in reading research reveals how text properties affect processing. Unexpected words increase fixation duration. Low-frequency words receive longer fixations. Syntactic ambiguity increases regression probability. These patterns provide real-time measures of comprehension processes (Müller et al., 2016; Schutz et al., 2011).

### Attention and Cognitive Load

Eye movements index attention allocation because the eyes move to fixate attended objects. Saccade target selection reflects the current focus of spatial attention. However, attention and gaze can dissociate—covert attention allows attending to peripheral objects without eye movements.

Cognitive load affects eye movement patterns. High cognitive load reduces saccade frequency and increases fixation duration. Pupil diameter (measurable with video eye tracking but not EOG) increases with mental effort. Microsaccade rate decreases during difficult tasks, possibly reflecting attentional engagement.

### Clinical Diagnosis

Neurological disorders produce characteristic oculomotor abnormalities. Nystagmus (involuntary rhythmic eye movements) indicates vestibular or cerebellar dysfunction. Saccadic intrusions during fixation suggest disorders affecting brainstem oculomotor control. Smooth pursuit abnormalities occur in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar disorders. Progressive supranuclear palsy impairs vertical saccades before horizontal saccades.

Oculomotor examination can localize neurological lesions. Frontal eye field damage impairs voluntary saccades while sparing reflexive saccades and smooth pursuit. Parietal damage impairs attention-guided saccades. Cerebellar lesions produce saccadic dysmetria (inaccurate saccade amplitude) and impaired smooth pursuit.

### Historical Significance: Yarbus (1967)

Alfred Yarbus conducted seminal eye tracking research demonstrating that eye movements reveal cognitive processes. He recorded participants viewing Ilya Repin's painting "An Unexpected Visitor" under different instructions: free viewing, estimating material circumstances, estimating ages, remembering clothing, remembering positions, estimating how long the visitor had been away, and determining what the family was doing before arrival.

Each task produced distinct eye movement patterns. Free viewing distributed attention across faces and central figures. Estimating wealth focused on furnishings and clothing. Estimating ages concentrated on faces. The results demonstrated that eye movements are not passive responses to visual salience but active sampling guided by task goals and cognitive operations. This finding established that oculomotor behavior provides a window into ongoing cognitive processes.

## Advanced Topics

### Neural Control

Eye movements are controlled by distributed cortical and subcortical networks. The frontal eye fields (FEF) in frontal cortex generate voluntary saccades. The supplementary eye fields (SEF) control learned sequences of eye movements. The parietal eye fields (PEF) generate attention-guided saccades to salient stimuli. Visual cortex (V1-V5) processes target information and motion signals.

Subcortical structures implement motor commands. The superior colliculus in the midbrain generates rapid, reflexive saccades. The cerebellum adjusts saccade amplitude and smooth pursuit gain through learning. Brainstem nuclei directly control the six extraocular muscles: medial rectus, lateral rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, superior oblique, and inferior oblique.

Different eye movement types use partially separate pathways, explaining why lesions can dissociate them. A stroke patient may execute smooth pursuit normally but cannot generate voluntary saccades (FEF damage), or vice versa. This dissociation confirms that different neural systems control different movement types.

### Measurement of Visual Attention

EOG measures overt attention (where the eyes are directed) rather than covert attention (where attention is directed without eye movements). However, eye movements and attention are tightly coupled. Before each saccade, attention shifts to the saccade target approximately 50 ms in advance. This attentional shift is obligatory—you cannot make a saccade without first attending to the target location.

The temporal relationship between attention and eye movements can be studied using cueing paradigms. A peripheral cue automatically captures attention, followed by an eye movement if the stimulus remains present. Endogenous cues (like arrows) shift attention voluntarily without obligatory eye movements. These paradigms separate attentional and oculomotor components.

## Limitations and Considerations

### Spatial Resolution

EOG spatial resolution is limited to approximately 1-2° of visual angle, compared to 0.1-0.5° for video eye tracking. This limitation arises because EOG measures voltage gradients across relatively large electrode separations. Small eye movements produce small voltage changes that are difficult to distinguish from noise. Applications requiring precise fixation localization (reading research on individual letters, face perception studies examining specific features) benefit from video eye tracking.

### Artifact Sensitivity

Electrode impedance affects signal quality. High impedance reduces amplitude and increases noise. Proper skin preparation with abrasive gel and alcohol improves electrode-skin contact. Sweat and electrode gel drying change impedance over time, causing baseline drift. Long recording sessions require periodic impedance checks.

Facial muscle activity generates artifacts, particularly from corrugator (frowning), frontalis (eyebrow raising), and temporalis (jaw clenching) muscles. Instructing participants to relax facial muscles and minimize movements reduces artifacts. Independent component analysis can separate muscle artifacts from eye movement signals in combined EEG-EOG recordings.

### Calibration Drift

Calibration accuracy degrades over time. Electrode polarization, skin impedance changes, and shifts in electrode position alter the voltage-to-angle relationship. Recordings lasting longer than 15-20 minutes benefit from recalibration. Studies comparing EOG to video eye tracking find that recalibration significantly improves EOG accuracy (Müller et al., 2016).

### Torsional Movements

EOG cannot measure torsional eye movements (rotation around the viewing axis) because electrode placement detects only horizontal and vertical translations. Video-based systems measuring pupil orientation can detect torsion. However, torsional movements are small during most natural viewing tasks, limiting the practical impact of this limitation.

## Practical Considerations

### Experimental Design

Task instructions affect eye movement patterns. Participants should receive clear, specific instructions about where to look and whether eye movements are permitted or should be minimized. Fixation tasks require central fixation control—a small fixation marker helps maintain stable gaze. Free-viewing tasks should specify whether participants should examine the entire display or focus on specific regions.

Trial duration affects data quality. Short trials (1-2 seconds) minimize calibration drift. Long trials (>30 seconds) require robust drift correction algorithms. Breaks between trials allow blink opportunities, reducing blink frequency during critical measurement periods.

### Data Analysis

Saccade detection algorithms identify rapid changes in eye position exceeding velocity and acceleration thresholds. Fixation identification groups consecutive samples with similar positions, typically requiring stability for at least 100 ms. Smooth pursuit is identified by sustained movement matching target velocity.

Statistical analysis must account for within-subject dependencies. Repeated measures from the same participant violate independence assumptions. Mixed-effects models properly handle hierarchical data structure (multiple trials per participant, multiple participants per condition). Corrections for multiple comparisons are necessary when analyzing time series data with many time points.
