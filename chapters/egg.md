# Electrogastrography (EGG)

*Chapter in development with course contributors*

## Introduction

Your stomach has its own rhythm. Right now, whether you are aware of it or not, electrical waves are slowly traveling across your stomach wall approximately three times per minute. These gastric slow waves, generated by specialized pacemaker cells, coordinate the muscular contractions that mix food and propel it toward your intestines. Electrogastrography (EGG) captures these electrical signals non-invasively from electrodes placed on your abdomen.

EGG is often called the "ECG for the stomach," though the comparison understates the challenges involved. Gastric electrical signals are roughly ten times weaker than cardiac signals and travel much more slowly. While your heart generates sharp, distinct peaks that are easy to detect, your stomach produces slow, rolling waves that blur across tissue layers before reaching the skin surface. Despite these technical difficulties, EGG provides unique insights into digestive function, revealing patterns invisible to other methods.

This chapter examines EGG from both clinical and psychophysiological perspectives. Clinically, EGG helps diagnose motility disorders like gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Psychophysiologically, EGG illuminates the gut-brain connection, showing how stress, emotion, and neural regulation affect digestive processes. The stomach is not merely a passive food processor. It responds dynamically to autonomic nervous system signals, psychological states, and dietary composition.

## Gastric Anatomy and Function

### Stomach Structure

The stomach divides into several functional regions. The fundus, the upper dome-shaped portion, serves as a reservoir storing food immediately after swallowing. The body (corpus) occupies the central section, where initial mixing and breakdown occur. The antrum, the lower muscular portion near the pylorus, generates powerful contractions that grind food into smaller particles and propel it through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum.

This anatomical organization matters for EGG because different regions contribute differently to the recorded signal. The antrum generates the strongest and most organized slow waves, acting as the stomach's primary pumping station. Pacemaker activity originates along the greater curvature between fundus and corpus, then propagates in a coordinated wave toward the pylorus.

### The Role of Smooth Muscle

Unlike skeletal muscle (which contracts only when stimulated by motor neurons) or cardiac muscle (which generates its own rhythmic contractions), gastric smooth muscle has intermediate properties. It can contract spontaneously but does so in an uncoordinated manner without pacemaker guidance. The interstitial cells of Cajal provide this coordination, generating slow waves that entrain smooth muscle cells into synchronized contractions.

Slow waves themselves do not directly cause contractions. Instead, they periodically depolarize smooth muscle membranes toward threshold, creating windows during which additional stimulation (neural or hormonal) can trigger actual mechanical contraction. Think of slow waves as setting the tempo while other signals determine whether contraction actually occurs. This explains why EGG detects electrical activity even when mechanical motility is impaired.

## Interstitial Cells of Cajal

### Pacemaker Cells

Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are specialized cells embedded within smooth muscle layers, particularly concentrated along the greater curvature at the fundus-corpus junction. These cells spontaneously generate rhythmic electrical oscillations through cyclic opening and closing of ion channels. In humans, ICCs fire approximately three times per minute, creating the fundamental gastric rhythm.

ICCs form electrical synapses (gap junctions) with neighboring smooth muscle cells, allowing electrical current to flow directly from cell to cell. This creates functional syncytium where depolarization initiated in one ICC spreads across large regions of smooth muscle. The slow wave propagates at approximately 3 to 5 millimeters per second, taking several seconds to traverse from pacemaker region to pylorus.

Loss or dysfunction of ICCs disrupts gastric motility even when smooth muscle remains intact. Some forms of gastroparesis involve ICC degeneration, removing the coordinating signal despite preserved muscle tissue. This makes ICCs potential therapeutic targets for motility disorders.

### Network Organization

ICCs do not operate as isolated pacemakers. They form interconnected networks with specific spatial organization. The primary pacemaker network lies in the myenteric plexus (between circular and longitudinal muscle layers) along the greater curvature. Secondary networks within the circular muscle layer and near the submucosal border have different properties and respond differently to neural and hormonal signals.

This network architecture allows regional modulation. Vagal stimulation can enhance ICC activity in specific stomach regions without uniformly affecting the entire organ. Certain prostaglandins and neurotransmitters alter ICC firing patterns, adjusting the strength and coordination of slow waves. This provides multiple regulatory mechanisms for adapting gastric motility to changing digestive demands.

## Gastric Slow Waves

### Electrical Characteristics

Normal gastric slow waves in humans occur at approximately 0.05 Hz, corresponding to three cycles per minute. This frequency is remarkably stable across individuals and conditions. The slow wave consists of initial rapid depolarization followed by sustained plateau phase lasting several seconds, then repolarization back to resting potential.

Slow wave amplitude varies with recording location and physiological state. Amplitudes range from a few hundred microvolts to several millivolts when measured directly from the stomach wall, but attenuate to approximately 100 microvolts or less at the abdominal surface. This weak signal requires careful recording techniques and signal processing to distinguish from noise and artifacts.

The slow wave propagates antegrade (from fundus toward pylorus) under normal conditions. Propagation velocity increases slightly as the wave travels from corpus to antrum, reflecting regional differences in smooth muscle and ICC properties. Retrograde propagation or chaotic, multidirectional waves indicate pathological dysrhythmias.

### Relationship to Mechanical Contractions

Slow waves enable but do not guarantee mechanical contraction. When smooth muscle membranes reach threshold during the slow wave plateau phase, voltage-gated calcium channels open, triggering contraction. The strength of contraction depends on how much additional depolarization occurs beyond the slow wave baseline.

Neural and hormonal factors modulate this coupling between slow waves and contractions. Cholinergic stimulation (vagal activity) enhances contraction strength without necessarily changing slow wave frequency. Sympathetic activity can reduce contraction amplitude or even block contractions entirely while slow waves continue. This dissociation explains why EGG sometimes shows normal electrical patterns despite impaired mechanical emptying.

### Fasting and Fed States

During fasting, gastric electrical activity exhibits distinct patterns related to the migrating motor complex (MMC). The MMC consists of three phases cycling every 90 to 120 minutes. Phase I shows minimal activity. Phase II displays irregular contractions. Phase III, lasting about 10 minutes, produces intense, regular contractions that sweep residual material from the stomach into the intestines. EGG can detect these phase transitions through changes in slow wave regularity and amplitude.

After eating, slow waves show increased amplitude and more consistent propagation. This postprandial response reflects vagal activation and hormonal signals (gastrin, cholecystokinin) that enhance slow wave-contraction coupling. The strength and duration of postprandial changes correlate with meal composition. High-fat meals produce prolonged but weaker responses compared to high-protein or high-carbohydrate meals.

## Gastric Dysrhythmias

### Tachygastria

Tachygastria refers to abnormally fast gastric rhythm exceeding 3.75 cycles per minute, often in the range of 4 to 9 cycles per minute. This rapid rhythm disrupts normal peristaltic coordination. Instead of organized waves traveling from fundus to pylorus, tachygastria produces chaotic, incomplete contractions ineffective for propelling food.

Tachygastria commonly associates with nausea. The exact mechanism linking abnormal rhythm to nausea remains unclear, but theories suggest retrograde signaling to brainstem emetic centers or disrupted vagal afferent feedback. Motion sickness, pregnancy-related nausea, and certain medications can induce tachygastria. Patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome often show tachygastria during symptomatic periods.

Interestingly, tachygastria can occur without subjective symptoms in some individuals, suggesting the rhythm abnormality alone is insufficient to cause problems. The clinical significance depends on whether tachygastria accompanies reduced slow wave propagation and impaired mechanical emptying.

### Bradygastria

Bradygastria describes abnormally slow gastric rhythm below 2.5 cycles per minute. Bradygastria is less common than tachygastria but indicates severe disruption of pacemaker function. Possible mechanisms include ICC dysfunction, abnormal neural input, or metabolic disturbances affecting smooth muscle excitability.

Bradygastria often occurs in conjunction with reduced amplitude, suggesting overall weakening of pacemaker activity rather than just slowed frequency. This combination significantly impairs gastric emptying, producing symptoms of fullness, bloating, and discomfort after small meals.

### Arrhythmias and Uncoupling

Beyond frequency abnormalities, the stomach can exhibit irregular, chaotic rhythms with no stable dominant frequency. This gastric arrhythmia indicates complete loss of coordinated pacemaker control. Multiple competing pacemaker sites may generate conflicting signals, or ICC networks may fragment into isolated patches firing independently.

Uncoupling describes another pathological pattern where slow waves continue normally but fail to produce mechanical contractions. This dissociation can result from smooth muscle dysfunction, altered calcium handling, or impaired excitation-contraction coupling despite intact electrical pacemaker activity. EGG cannot directly detect uncoupling because it measures only electrical activity, requiring comparison with other methods (manometry, scintigraphy) to identify mechanical failure.

## Recording Methodology

### Electrode Placement

Surface electrodes are placed on the abdomen in configurations designed to capture slow wave propagation. A common setup uses four electrodes arranged vertically along the midline or slightly to the left of midline, spanning from xiphoid process to umbilicus. Alternative configurations place electrodes at multiple lateral positions to triangulate signal sources.

Precise placement is less critical than in ECG recording because gastric signals are diffuse and spatially broad. However, consistent placement improves signal quality and comparability across sessions. The skin should be cleaned but not abraded. Electrode gel or paste ensures good electrical contact.

Reference and ground electrodes are placed laterally on the ribs or lower thorax, away from gastric signal sources. Some systems use additional electrodes to detect and subtract cardiac, respiratory, and electromyographic artifacts contaminating the gastric signal.

### Patient Preparation

Participants fast for at least four hours before recording to establish stable baseline activity. Fasting eliminates postprandial responses and allows measurement of basal slow wave patterns. Some protocols extend fasting overnight to capture the complete MMC cycle.

After baseline recording (typically 30 minutes), participants consume a standardized test meal. The meal should be sufficiently large to stimulate gastric responses but not so large as to cause discomfort. Common choices include liquid nutrition drinks, solid meals with known composition, or water loads. Recording continues for 60 to 120 minutes postprandially to capture the full response.

Participants should remain still and quiet during recording. Movement produces artifacts that can overwhelm the weak gastric signal. Talking, shifting position, and abdominal muscle contractions all generate noise. Some laboratories ask participants to breathe normally but avoid deep breaths or coughing during critical measurement periods.

### Signal Acquisition

EGG signals are amplified by factors of 1,000 to 10,000 to bring microvolt-level signals to detectable ranges. High-pass filtering (typically 0.01 to 0.03 Hz cutoff) removes slow baseline drift. Low-pass filtering (typically 0.15 to 0.25 Hz cutoff) eliminates high-frequency noise from cardiac activity, respiration, and muscle activity. A notch filter at 50 or 60 Hz removes electrical line noise.

Digitization occurs at sampling rates of 1 to 4 Hz. While this seems slow compared to EEG or ECG sampling (hundreds to thousands of Hz), it is adequate for gastric signals that change over seconds rather than milliseconds. Higher sampling rates primarily capture noise rather than additional gastric information.

Recording duration must be sufficient to capture multiple slow wave cycles for reliable frequency estimation. Thirty minutes provides roughly 90 slow wave cycles, enough for stable frequency analysis. Shorter recordings risk missing transient dysrhythmias or mistaking artifact for genuine gastric rhythm.

## Signal Analysis

### Time Domain Features

Visual inspection of the EGG waveform can reveal gross abnormalities. Normal traces show regular, sinusoidal oscillations at approximately 3 cycles per minute with relatively consistent amplitude. Tachygastric episodes appear as regions of increased frequency. Bradygastric periods show prolonged intervals between peaks. Arrhythmic segments display irregular, chaotic patterns.

However, visual analysis is subjective and insensitive to subtle changes. Quantitative time domain measures include cycle duration (time between successive peaks), amplitude (peak-to-trough voltage), and regularity indices (coefficient of variation of cycle durations). These measures provide objective descriptions but do not fully characterize frequency content or identify mixed dysrhythmias.

### Frequency Domain Analysis

Spectral analysis transforms the time-domain signal into frequency components using Fast Fourier Transform or related techniques. The resulting power spectrum shows how much signal power exists at each frequency. A dominant peak at 3 cycles per minute indicates normal gastric rhythm. Peaks at higher frequencies suggest tachygastria; peaks at lower frequencies suggest bradygastria.

The dominant frequency (DF) is the frequency with maximum power in the gastric range (typically defined as 2 to 4 cycles per minute). The percentage of power in the normal frequency band (2.5 to 3.75 cpm) serves as an index of rhythm stability. Values above 70% typically indicate normal gastric rhythm. Values below 50% suggest significant dysrhythmia.

Power ratios compare postprandial to fasting spectral power. Healthy individuals show increased power after eating, reflecting enhanced slow wave amplitude and coordination. The power ratio (postprandial power divided by fasting power) normally exceeds 2.0. Reduced power ratios indicate impaired meal responses, possibly from autonomic dysfunction or ICC abnormalities.

### Artifact Management

Cardiac signals pose a major challenge because the heart's electrical activity is orders of magnitude stronger than gastric signals. Cardiac rhythms appear as peaks near 1 Hz in the spectrum. Careful filtering removes most cardiac contamination, though very strong cardiac signals can alias into the gastric frequency range.

Respiratory rhythms (typically 0.15 to 0.4 Hz) also contaminate EGG recordings. Deep breathing produces rhythmic abdominal muscle activity and diaphragm movement that modulate electrode impedance. Asking participants to breathe shallowly or at controlled rates can minimize respiratory artifacts, though this may affect gastric activity through vagal mechanisms.

Body movement creates large, unpredictable artifacts. Automated algorithms can detect and reject contaminated segments. Alternatively, recordings can be paused during unavoidable movements. Some advanced systems use multiple electrode channels with spatial filtering techniques to separate gastric sources from noise sources.

## Clinical Applications

### Gastroparesis

Gastroparesis, literally "stomach paralysis," describes delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, and abdominal pain. Causes include diabetes (neuropathy affecting vagal control and ICC function), post-surgical vagal nerve damage, and idiopathic cases with unknown etiology.

EGG findings in gastroparesis often include tachygastria, reduced postprandial power increase, and uncoordinated slow waves. However, EGG patterns are not perfectly diagnostic. Some gastroparesis patients show normal EGG rhythms, particularly if the problem involves slow wave-contraction uncoupling rather than pacemaker dysfunction. Conversely, some individuals with gastric dysrhythmias on EGG have normal emptying rates.

Treatment approaches include dietary modifications (small, frequent meals; reduced fat content), prokinetic medications (metoclopramide, erythromycin), antiemetics, and in severe cases gastric electrical stimulation using implanted pacemakers. EGG can monitor treatment effectiveness by showing normalization of gastric rhythms and enhanced meal responses.

### Functional Dyspepsia

Functional dyspepsia describes chronic upper abdominal discomfort without identifiable structural or biochemical cause. Patients experience early satiety, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and burning, but endoscopy and other tests reveal no ulcers, inflammation, or anatomical abnormalities. The condition reflects disturbed gastric sensorimotor function.

Many functional dyspepsia patients show subtle EGG abnormalities including mild tachygastria, reduced postprandial power increase, or unstable dominant frequency. These abnormalities may reflect underlying autonomic dysregulation, altered vagal tone, or subclinical ICC dysfunction. The relationship between EGG patterns and symptom severity is inconsistent, suggesting multiple mechanisms contribute to the syndrome.

### Motion Sickness and Nausea

Motion sickness reliably induces tachygastria in susceptible individuals. Laboratory studies using rotating chairs or optokinetic stimulation show progressive increase in gastric frequency from normal 3 cpm toward 4 to 6 cpm as nausea develops. Tachygastria appears before subjective nausea reports, suggesting electrical changes precede conscious symptoms.

The mechanism linking motion sickness to gastric dysrhythmia involves vestibular-vagal pathways. Conflicting sensory information from visual and vestibular systems activates brainstem circuits that alter vagal outflow to the stomach. This disrupts normal ICC pacemaker activity, producing tachygastria and associated nausea.

Pregnancy-related nausea (morning sickness) similarly associates with tachygastria. Women experiencing severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy show higher tachygastria prevalence than asymptomatic pregnant women. The mechanism may involve hormonal effects (human chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone) on gastric smooth muscle and ICC function.

## Psychophysiological Perspectives

### Stress and Autonomic Regulation

Psychological stress profoundly affects gastric function through autonomic nervous system pathways. Acute stress typically activates sympathetic responses and reduces vagal tone, disrupting normal gastric rhythms and slowing emptying. The proverbial "butterflies in the stomach" reflects this stress-induced gastric dysrhythmia.

Laboratory stress paradigms (mental arithmetic, public speaking, cold pressor test) alter EGG patterns. Common findings include increased tachygastria prevalence, reduced slow wave amplitude, and blunted postprandial responses. Individual differences in stress reactivity correlate with magnitude of gastric rhythm disruption, suggesting some people have more stress-sensitive digestive systems.

Chronic stress relates differently to gastric function than acute stress. Prolonged stress can produce vagal withdrawal, sympathetic dominance, and sustained alterations in gastric motility patterns. This may contribute to functional dyspepsia and other stress-related gastrointestinal disorders. However, some chronically stressed individuals show paradoxical upregulation of digestive function, possibly reflecting adaptation mechanisms.

### Gut-Brain Axis

The gut-brain axis describes bidirectional communication between gastrointestinal system and central nervous system. This communication operates through multiple channels: autonomic nervous system (especially vagal nerve), hormonal signals, immune system mediators, and potentially gut microbiota metabolites affecting brain function.

EGG contributes to understanding this axis by revealing how central nervous system states influence peripheral gastrointestinal electrical activity. Conversely, gastric signals transmit to the brain via vagal afferents, influencing emotional states, cognitive function, and interoceptive awareness. Some research suggests gastric rhythm entrainment or disruption can alter cognitive performance and emotional processing.

The relationship between gastric function and psychological state is complex and bidirectional. Anxiety can produce gastric dysrhythmias, but gastric dysrhythmias can also increase anxiety through uncomfortable sensations and altered interoceptive processing. This creates potential feedback loops where gut problems exacerbate psychological distress and vice versa.

### Emotion and Eating Behavior

Emotions affect both food intake and gastric processing. Stress-induced eating involves complex interactions between hedonic food reward systems, stress-responsive neuroendocrine pathways, and altered gastric responses to food. Some individuals eat more under stress; others lose appetite. These differences may partly reflect individual variation in how stress affects gastric motility and hunger signaling.

EGG studies examining meal responses under different emotional conditions show that negative emotions can reduce postprandial power increase and produce dysrhythmic patterns even during eating. This suggests emotional state directly modulates the stomach's ability to process food efficiently. Over time, chronic emotional distress might contribute to digestive complaints independent of specific psychological diagnoses.

## Methodological Considerations

### Interpreting EGG Data

EGG provides valuable information but has important limitations. The technique measures electrical activity, not mechanical function. Normal EGG does not guarantee normal emptying. Abnormal EGG does not always correlate with symptoms. Interpretation requires considering EGG results within broader clinical and physiological context.

Individual variation in abdominal anatomy, adipose tissue distribution, and smooth muscle electrical properties affects surface signal characteristics. Standardization of meal composition, recording conditions, and analysis parameters improves reproducibility but cannot eliminate all variability. Within-subject designs comparing different conditions in the same individual are more powerful than between-subject comparisons.

### Complementary Measures

Combining EGG with other assessment methods provides more complete understanding. Gastric emptying scintigraphy directly measures mechanical emptying rate, revealing whether electrical abnormalities translate to impaired food transit. Manometry records intraluminal pressure changes from muscular contractions, showing slow wave-contraction coupling. Ultrasound can visualize gastric contractions and volume changes non-invasively.

Patient-reported symptoms and quality of life measures contextualize physiological findings. A patient with mild EGG abnormalities but severe symptoms requires different management than someone with marked dysrhythmias but minimal complaints. Psychological assessment (anxiety, depression, somatization) helps identify when gastric problems exist within broader patterns of stress-related dysfunction.

## Advanced Topics

### Gastric Electrical Stimulation

Gastric electrical stimulation uses implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to the stomach wall. The technique aims to restore coordinated contractions in patients with refractory gastroparesis. Devices deliver pulses at higher frequency than natural slow waves (typically 12 pulses per minute), though the mechanism of benefit remains debated.

Some patients experience substantial symptom relief despite minimal objective improvement in emptying rates. This suggests mechanisms beyond simple pacemaker replacement, possibly involving neural reflex modulation, altered sensory processing, or placebo effects. EGG can monitor how electrical stimulation affects endogenous gastric rhythms and identify patients most likely to benefit.

### Cutaneous Electrogastrography vs. Internal Recording

Cutaneous EGG trades signal quality for non-invasiveness. Internal electrodes (placed via endoscopy or surgically) record much stronger signals with better spatial resolution. Studies comparing simultaneous cutaneous and internal recording show reasonable correlation for dominant frequency and major rhythm abnormalities but poor agreement on subtle features.

This validation work confirms cutaneous EGG detects clinically significant dysrhythmias while missing fine details visible only with internal electrodes. For most clinical and research applications, the non-invasive nature of surface recording outweighs the reduced signal quality. Internal recording remains valuable for research examining specific mechanisms and validating new analysis techniques.

### Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

Automated analysis algorithms using machine learning can classify EGG patterns more objectively than visual inspection. Training classifiers on large datasets of normal and pathological recordings enables automated dysrhythmia detection, severity grading, and treatment response prediction. These approaches may identify subtle patterns invisible to conventional analysis.

However, machine learning models require careful validation. They can overfit training data, performing well on development datasets but poorly on new data. Interpretability challenges arise when black-box algorithms make clinical predictions without clear physiological rationale. Despite these limitations, advanced computational methods will likely improve EGG clinical utility and research applications.
