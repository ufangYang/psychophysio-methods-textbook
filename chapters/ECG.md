## Introduction

Your heart beats roughly 100,000 times per day without you thinking about it. Each beat involves precisely coordinated electrical signals traveling through specialized pathways, triggering mechanical contractions that pump blood throughout your body. Electrocardiography (ECG) captures these electrical signals from electrodes placed on your skin, providing a real-time view of your heart's electrical activity.

ECG is simultaneously simple and profound. The technique is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and widely accessible. Yet it reveals intricate details about cardiac function, autonomic nervous system balance, emotional states, and stress responses. Whether you are diagnosing arrhythmias in a hospital, studying stress in a laboratory, or tracking fitness with a smartwatch, you are using principles of electrocardiography.

This chapter focuses on ECG from a psychophysiological perspective. While clinical cardiology uses ECG primarily to diagnose heart disease, psychophysiology uses ECG to understand the connection between mind and body. Changes in heart rate and rhythm reflect autonomic nervous system activity, which in turn responds to psychological states like stress, anxiety, relaxation, and cognitive load.

## Cardiac Physiology Foundation

### Heart Structure

The heart has four chambers working in coordinated sequence. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body. The right ventricle pumps this blood to the lungs for oxygenation. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. The left ventricle, the heart's most powerful chamber, pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body. Valves between chambers ensure blood flows in one direction, preventing backflow.

This mechanical pumping depends entirely on electrical signals. Unlike skeletal muscle (which requires nervous system commands to contract), cardiac muscle generates its own electrical impulses. This intrinsic rhythm means a heart removed from the body continues beating for a time, powered by its internal electrical system.

### The Cardiac Conduction System

The sinoatrial (SA) node, located in the right atrium, is the heart's natural pacemaker. Specialized cells in the SA node spontaneously depolarize approximately 60 to 100 times per minute at rest, generating electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat. This automaticity means the heart sets its own rhythm, though the autonomic nervous system modulates the rate.

From the SA node, the electrical impulse spreads across both atria, causing them to contract simultaneously. This atrial contraction pushes blood into the ventricles. The impulse then reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node, located at the junction between atria and ventricles.

The AV node introduces a crucial delay of approximately 0.1 seconds. This delay ensures the atria finish contracting and emptying their blood into the ventricles before ventricular contraction begins. Without this delay, the heart would pump inefficiently, with atria and ventricles contracting simultaneously.

From the AV node, the impulse travels rapidly through the Bundle of His, which splits into left and right bundle branches descending along the interventricular septum. These branches divide into an intricate network of Purkinje fibers that penetrate deep into the ventricular walls. This specialized conduction system ensures the ventricles contract from bottom to top (apex to base), effectively squeezing blood upward and out through the major arteries.

After depolarization comes repolarization. The heart muscle must recover electrically before it can contract again. Repolarization takes longer than depolarization and occurs somewhat more variably across the ventricular muscle, creating characteristic ECG patterns.

## The ECG Waveform

### Component Waves

A normal ECG waveform displays three major deflections: the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. Together, these components represent one complete cardiac cycle lasting approximately 0.8 seconds at a resting heart rate of 75 beats per minute.

The **P wave** is a small, rounded deflection representing atrial depolarization. When the SA node fires, the electrical impulse spreads across the atrial muscle, producing the P wave. Normal P waves are upright in most leads, modest in amplitude (less than 0.25 mV), and brief in duration (less than 0.12 seconds). Abnormal P waves can indicate atrial enlargement, irregular atrial rhythms, or ectopic pacemaker sites.

You might wonder: where is atrial repolarization? It occurs during ventricular depolarization, hidden within the much larger QRS complex. The ventricles contain far more muscle mass than the atria, so their electrical signals dominate and obscure the smaller atrial repolarization wave.

The **QRS complex** is the most prominent ECG feature, representing ventricular depolarization. The name comes from the sequence of deflections: a small downward Q wave (if present), a large upward R wave, and a downward S wave. The entire complex typically lasts 0.06 to 0.10 seconds. Its large amplitude (up to 1 to 3 mV in some leads) reflects the substantial muscle mass of the ventricles and the speed of conduction through Purkinje fibers.

The shape and duration of the QRS complex provide diagnostic information. A wide QRS complex (greater than 0.12 seconds) indicates delayed conduction through the ventricles, possibly from bundle branch block or ventricular origin of the heartbeat. The amplitude varies with body habitus, electrode placement, and cardiac position.

The **T wave** represents ventricular repolarization, the recovery phase when the ventricular muscle returns to its resting electrical state. T waves are typically upright, asymmetric (slower rising slope than falling slope), and smaller than the QRS complex. The T wave shape is influenced by electrolyte balance (particularly potassium), ischemia, and medications affecting cardiac repolarization.

### Intervals and Segments

ECG interpretation requires examining not just the waves themselves but also the intervals and segments between them.

The **PR interval** extends from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, normally lasting 0.12 to 0.20 seconds. This interval represents the time required for the impulse to travel from the SA node through the atria, pause at the AV node, and begin ventricular depolarization. A prolonged PR interval indicates delayed AV conduction (first-degree heart block). A very short PR interval might suggest an accessory pathway bypassing the AV node, as seen in certain arrhythmias.

The **QT interval** spans from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave, typically 0.35 to 0.45 seconds (varying with heart rate). This interval represents the total duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Prolonged QT intervals are clinically significant because they increase vulnerability to dangerous ventricular arrhythmias. Multiple medications, genetic conditions, and electrolyte disturbances can prolong the QT interval, requiring careful monitoring.

The **ST segment** is the flat (isoelectric) line between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the T wave. This segment represents early ventricular repolarization. Normally, the ST segment sits at the same baseline level as the PR segment. ST segment elevation can indicate acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). ST segment depression suggests myocardial ischemia (inadequate oxygen supply). These ST segment changes make ECG invaluable for emergency cardiac assessment.

The **RR interval** is the time between consecutive R waves, directly reflecting the time between heartbeats. Heart rate can be calculated from the RR interval: heart rate (beats per minute) = 60 / RR interval (in seconds). More importantly for psychophysiology, variations in RR intervals (beat-to-beat changes) provide the raw data for heart rate variability analysis.

## Autonomic Nervous System Control

Heart rate is not fixed. The autonomic nervous system continuously adjusts cardiac activity to meet changing physiological and psychological demands. This regulation involves both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches working in opposition.

The **sympathetic nervous system** accelerates heart rate, increases contractile force, and speeds conduction through the AV node. Sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine at cardiac synapses, binding to beta-adrenergic receptors on cardiac muscle cells. This increases the slope of spontaneous depolarization in the SA node, causing it to reach threshold faster and fire more frequently. Sympathetic activation is your body's accelerator pedal, preparing for action, increasing alertness, and responding to stressors.

The **parasympathetic nervous system**, specifically the vagus nerve, slows heart rate and reduces contractile force. Vagal fibers release acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic receptors and hyperpolarizes SA node cells, making them take longer to reach threshold. This is your body's brake pedal, promoting rest, digestion, and recovery.

Importantly, these two systems operate continuously in dynamic balance. At rest, vagal tone predominates, keeping heart rate below its intrinsic rate (which would be approximately 100 bpm without any autonomic influence). During stress or exercise, sympathetic activity increases while vagal withdrawal removes the brake, allowing heart rate to rise rapidly.

This dual control creates beat-to-beat variability. Your heart rate is not a metronome. It fluctuates constantly, responding to breathing, blood pressure changes, emotional states, and cognitive demands. These fluctuations, collectively termed heart rate variability (HRV), provide a window into autonomic function and psychological state.

## Heart Rate Variability

### Conceptual Foundation

Heart rate variability measures the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. High HRV indicates that your heart rate fluctuates substantially beat-to-beat. Low HRV means beat-to-beat intervals are relatively constant. Counterintuitively, high HRV is generally healthy, reflecting a responsive autonomic nervous system capable of flexibly adjusting to changing demands.

Think of HRV as the opposite of a rigid machine. A healthy cardiovascular system displays complex, fluctuating rhythms because multiple regulatory mechanisms operate simultaneously: breathing influences vagal tone, blood pressure regulation via baroreceptors, thermoregulation, hormonal signals, and local metabolic demands all contribute to moment-to-moment heart rate adjustments. This complexity produces variability.

Reduced HRV often indicates autonomic imbalance or reduced regulatory capacity. Chronic stress, certain cardiac conditions, diabetes, depression, and aging all tend to reduce HRV. Conversely, physical fitness, meditation practice, and psychological resilience associate with higher HRV. This makes HRV a valuable marker of both physiological and psychological health.

### Time Domain Measures

Time domain HRV analysis examines the RR intervals directly. The simplest measure is SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals), calculated over a defined period (typically 5 minutes for short-term recordings or 24 hours for Holter monitoring). SDNN reflects total variability from all sources. Higher SDNN indicates greater overall HRV.

RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) specifically captures short-term, beat-to-beat variability. It is calculated by taking each pair of consecutive RR intervals, computing their difference, squaring these differences, averaging them, and taking the square root. RMSSD predominantly reflects parasympathetic (vagal) activity because vagal influences change rapidly, affecting beat-to-beat intervals. Sympathetic influences change more slowly and contribute less to very short-term variability.

pNN50 (percentage of successive RR intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds) provides another vagally-mediated index. High pNN50 indicates frequent large beat-to-beat changes, characteristic of strong parasympathetic modulation.

### Frequency Domain Measures

Frequency domain analysis applies mathematical transformations (typically Fast Fourier Transform) to decompose HRV into component frequencies. This reveals that heart rate fluctuations occur at specific frequencies corresponding to different physiological mechanisms.

High frequency (HF) power, typically defined as 0.15 to 0.40 Hz (corresponding to cycles every 2.5 to 6.7 seconds), primarily reflects respiratory sinus arrhythmia, the heart rate fluctuation synchronized with breathing. HF power is mediated almost entirely by vagal activity and serves as a frequency-domain marker of parasympathetic tone.

Low frequency (LF) power (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) reflects multiple influences including both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, baroreceptor regulation, and slower oscillations. The interpretation of LF power remains debated. It was once considered a marker of sympathetic activity, but current understanding recognizes substantial parasympathetic contribution as well.

The LF/HF ratio was historically interpreted as sympathovagal balance. However, this interpretation is now questioned because both components contain mixed influences. Many researchers prefer examining HF power alone as a more specific vagal index, or using time-domain measures like RMSSD that have clearer physiological interpretation.

### Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is the heart rate increase during inhalation and decrease during exhalation, visible as rhythmic oscillation in the RR interval series. This phenomenon demonstrates intimate brain-heart-lung coordination.

During inhalation, lung expansion stretches mechanoreceptors that signal the brainstem, triggering transient vagal withdrawal. With the vagal brake momentarily released, heart rate accelerates. During exhalation, vagal tone returns, slowing heart rate. This produces a characteristic pattern: longest RR intervals occur during exhalation; shortest intervals occur during inhalation.

RSA amplitude reflects vagal tone strength. Individuals with high vagal activity show pronounced RSA (large heart rate fluctuations with breathing). Those with low vagal tone show minimal RSA. Slow, deep breathing at approximately 5 to 6 breaths per minute amplifies RSA because this breathing rate aligns with the natural resonance frequency of the cardiovascular system, maximizing baroreflex gain and vagal modulation.

RSA has become a key measure in psychophysiology. It indexes emotion regulation capacity, stress resilience, and attentional control. Higher RSA correlates with better executive function, more effective emotion regulation, and greater psychological flexibility. Biofeedback interventions teach slow breathing to increase RSA, thereby strengthening vagal tone and improving stress management.

## Recording Methods

### Standard 12-Lead Clinical ECG

Clinical medicine uses 12-lead ECG to provide comprehensive views of cardiac electrical activity from multiple angles. Ten electrodes placed on limbs and chest generate 12 different perspectives (leads) by computing voltage differences between electrode pairs. This multi-view approach helps localize cardiac abnormalities to specific heart regions.

For psychophysiological research, 12-lead ECG is unnecessary. Most psychological studies require only heart rate and HRV information, obtainable from simpler electrode configurations.

### Lead II Configuration

Lead II, recording the voltage difference between the right arm and left leg, is commonly used in psychophysiology. This lead alignment roughly parallels the heart's electrical axis, producing clear P waves and tall R waves ideal for heartbeat detection. Three electrodes suffice: right arm (or right upper chest), left leg (or left lower torso), and ground.

Electrode placement need not be anatomically precise for HRV analysis. The exact voltage amplitude matters little; what matters is accurately detecting each heartbeat's timing. Modified placements using only the torso reduce movement artifact and improve participant comfort during psychological tasks.

### Signal Processing for HRV

Raw ECG requires processing before HRV analysis. The signal is amplified, filtered (typically 0.05 to 100 Hz bandpass), and digitized at rates of 250 to 1000 Hz. Higher sampling rates improve temporal precision in R-wave detection.

Automated algorithms detect R-waves using amplitude thresholds, slope detection, or more sophisticated pattern recognition. Each detected R-wave generates a timestamp. The series of RR intervals (time between consecutive R-waves) forms the tachogram, which is then analyzed for HRV metrics.

Artifact correction is essential. Ectopic beats, movement artifacts, and detection errors create spurious RR intervals that distort HRV metrics. Visual inspection should verify automated detection. Artifacts can be removed, interpolated, or corrected using various algorithms. Reporting the percentage of artifacts in your data ensures transparency about signal quality.

## Applications in Psychophysiology

### Stress and Emotion Research

Acute stress typically increases heart rate (sympathetic activation plus vagal withdrawal) and decreases HRV (reduced parasympathetic modulation). Laboratory stressors like public speaking, mental arithmetic, or cold pressor tests reliably produce these patterns. Chronic stress shows different profiles, often with blunted cardiovascular reactivity rather than exaggerated responses.

Emotion regulation capacity correlates with HRV. Individuals with higher resting HRV show better emotion regulation, more adaptive responses to stress, and greater psychological flexibility. This suggests HRV reflects not just cardiovascular health but also neurovisceral integration, the brain's capacity to regulate both physiological and psychological states.

Anxiety disorders frequently show reduced HRV. Post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder all associate with lower HRV, particularly reduced vagally-mediated measures. This autonomic dysregulation may contribute to the disorder or result from chronic hyperarousal.

### Clinical Applications

Certain cardiac conditions alter ECG patterns in diagnostically useful ways. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) produces characteristic ST segment elevation, T wave changes, and sometimes new Q waves. Arrhythmias show abnormal rhythms: atrial fibrillation has absent P waves and irregularly irregular QRS complexes; ventricular tachycardia shows wide QRS complexes at rapid rates.

However, psychophysiology focuses less on diagnosing primary cardiac disease and more on cardiovascular indicators of autonomic function and psychological state. Reduced HRV predicts mortality after myocardial infarction, not because HRV directly causes death but because it indexes autonomic dysfunction that increases risk.

### Biofeedback and Training

HRV biofeedback trains individuals to increase their heart rate variability through slow, paced breathing. Real-time displays show HRV metrics while participants practice breathing at approximately 5 to 6 breaths per minute. This resonance frequency breathing maximizes RSA amplitude and strengthens vagal tone.

Multiple sessions of HRV biofeedback can produce sustained increases in resting HRV. Clinical applications include treating anxiety, depression, chronic pain, hypertension, and asthma. The mechanism likely involves both direct physiological effects (increased vagal tone) and psychological benefits (enhanced sense of physiological control, reduced perceived stress).

### Wearable Technology

Consumer devices now provide continuous heart rate and HRV monitoring. Chest straps, wrist-worn optical sensors, and even smartphone cameras can detect heartbeats and calculate basic HRV metrics. While these devices vary in accuracy compared to research-grade ECG, they enable ecological momentary assessment in everyday life.

These technologies support personalized health monitoring, stress management, and performance optimization. Athletes use HRV to guide training intensity, resting when HRV is low (indicating inadequate recovery) and training harder when HRV is high. Individuals track their stress responses and learn which activities promote recovery.

## Methodological Considerations

ECG recording requires careful attention to electrode placement, skin preparation, and environmental control. Electrodes should be placed over relatively stationary tissue rather than areas of muscle movement. Skin should be cleaned with alcohol and, if necessary, lightly abraded to reduce impedance.

Participants should rest quietly for at least 5 minutes before baseline HRV assessment. Recent caffeine, nicotine, heavy meals, or exercise all affect cardiac activity and should be controlled. Respiratory rate significantly influences HRV, so some protocols ask participants to breathe at a fixed rate (though this eliminates natural RSA patterns).

HRV interpretation must consider multiple factors. Age strongly affects HRV, with variability decreasing across the lifespan. Physical fitness increases HRV. Medications (especially beta-blockers and anticholinergics) alter cardiac autonomic control. Time of day matters, with circadian rhythms affecting autonomic tone.

Statistical analysis of HRV requires careful consideration. Most HRV metrics are not normally distributed, often requiring logarithmic transformation. Within-subject designs are more powerful than between-subject comparisons because individuals differ substantially in baseline HRV. Reporting multiple HRV metrics (both time and frequency domain) provides a more complete picture than relying on a single measure.

## Advanced Topics

### Polyvagal Theory

Polyvagal theory, proposed by Stephen Porges, suggests the vagus nerve comprises two distinct systems: a newer, myelinated pathway (ventral vagal) supporting social engagement and calm states, and an older, unmyelinated pathway (dorsal vagal) involved in immobilization and shutdown responses. RSA specifically indexes ventral vagal function, which actively promotes calmness and social connection.

This theory has influenced psychophysiology research on trauma, attachment, and social behavior. Higher RSA may reflect not just general parasympathetic tone but specifically the capacity for social engagement and flexible responding to environmental demands.

### Nonlinear HRV Measures

Beyond traditional time and frequency domain analysis, nonlinear methods characterize the complex, chaotic nature of healthy heart rate dynamics. Metrics like approximate entropy, sample entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis quantify the regularity and fractal properties of RR interval series.

Healthy heart rate dynamics show complex, irregular patterns. Overly regular heart rate (high predictability, low entropy) paradoxically indicates reduced physiological flexibility, seen in aging and disease. These nonlinear measures complement traditional HRV metrics by capturing different aspects of cardiovascular regulation.

### Heart-Brain Coupling

Recent research examines bidirectional communication between heart and brain. The heart sends more information to the brain than vice versa via vagal afferents. Cardiac signals influence emotional processing, perception, and cognition. For example, presenting emotional stimuli synchronized with heartbeats enhances their perceived intensity.

This cardiac interoception, the brain's representation of internal bodily signals, plays important roles in emotion, decision-making, and self-awareness. Individual differences in cardiac interoceptive accuracy correlate with emotional experience and psychiatric symptoms.
