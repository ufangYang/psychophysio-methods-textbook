# Electrodermal Activity (EDA)

*Revised by: Jonathan Pioch and course contributors*

## Introduction

Electrodermal activity (EDA) measures how easily electrical current flows across your skin. This might sound abstract, but the principle is straightforward: when you sweat, your skin becomes more electrically conductive. Since sweat gland activity is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (the part of your autonomic nervous system you cannot consciously control), EDA provides a direct window into your body's arousal state.

Think about the last time you felt nervous before a presentation. Your palms probably got sweaty. That perspiration made your skin more conductive. EDA captures exactly this physiological response, quantifying emotional and cognitive arousal through changes in skin conductance.

The method has broad applications. Psychologists use EDA to study stress and emotion. Clinical researchers examine anxiety disorders and phobias. Applied researchers employ EDA in lie detection (polygraph tests), consumer behavior studies, and biofeedback therapy. The technique is non-invasive, relatively simple, and provides reliable indicators of sympathetic nervous system activity.

## The Autonomic Nervous System Context

Understanding EDA requires understanding the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which regulates unconscious bodily functions. The ANS has two divisions working in opposition: the sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division.

The sympathetic nervous system prepares your body for action. When activated, it increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion, and activates sweat glands. This is your "fight or flight" response. The parasympathetic division does the opposite, promoting rest and digestion through actions like slowing heart rate, constricting pupils, and stimulating digestive processes.

**EDA is unique because it measures purely sympathetic activity.** Unlike heart rate (influenced by both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems), sweat glands receive only sympathetic innervation. This makes EDA a direct, unambiguous measure of sympathetic arousal. When you see increased skin conductance, you know the sympathetic nervous system is active.

## Physiological Basis

### Eccrine Sweat Glands

The human body contains two types of sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine. EDA specifically measures eccrine gland activity. These glands are distributed across the body but concentrate on palms, soles, and forehead. Unlike apocrine glands (which produce the sweat that causes body odor), eccrine glands produce clear, odorless sweat.

Eccrine glands serve two functions: thermoregulation and emotional sweating. When your body overheats, eccrine glands produce sweat for cooling. But these same glands also respond to psychological stimuli. Stress, fear, excitement, and cognitive effort all trigger eccrine gland activation, even when body temperature remains constant. This emotional sweating is what EDA measures.

The glands themselves are tiny coiled tubes embedded in the dermis (the middle skin layer). When activated by sympathetic nerve signals, they produce sweat that travels through ducts up to the skin surface. This process happens rapidly, typically within one to three seconds of stimulus onset.

### Skin Structure and Conductance

Skin has three main layers. The epidermis is the outer layer, with the stratum corneum (dead skin cells) forming its outermost surface. The dermis sits beneath, containing blood vessels, nerve endings, and sweat glands. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer) lies deepest, containing fat tissue.

The stratum corneum normally acts as an electrical insulator with high resistance. Dry skin conducts electricity poorly. But sweat changes everything. When sweat fills the ducts penetrating through the stratum corneum, it creates low-resistance pathways. The ions in sweat (sodium, potassium, chloride) conduct electricity effectively.

Think of the stratum corneum as a barrier with gates. Sweat-filled ducts are open gates through which electrical current flows easily. More sweat means more open gates, which means higher conductance. EDA measures this conductance change, providing an indirect but reliable index of sweat gland activity.

### Neural Control

The hypothalamus and brainstem regulate sympathetic outflow to sweat glands. Emotional arousal activates these brain regions, which send signals down the spinal cord to sympathetic ganglia. From there, postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine at the sweat glands, triggering sweat production.

This pathway is fast and direct. Unlike hormonal responses (which can take minutes), sympathetic neural signals reach sweat glands in seconds. This makes EDA particularly useful for studying moment-to-moment changes in arousal during psychological tasks.

Importantly, you cannot voluntarily control eccrine gland activity on your palms and soles. You might be able to think calming thoughts to reduce arousal, but you cannot directly command your palms to stop sweating. This involuntary nature makes EDA resistant to conscious manipulation, though not completely immune to it.

## Measurement Approaches

### Exosomatic Method

The exosomatic method applies a small, constant external current across two electrodes placed on the skin, then measures the resulting voltage. Using Ohm's law (voltage = current × resistance), we can calculate skin conductance (the inverse of resistance). This is the most common EDA measurement approach in research.

Electrodes are typically placed on the palmar surface of the fingers or hand (medial phalanges of the index and middle fingers, or thenar and hypothenar eminences). These sites have high concentrations of eccrine glands and relatively consistent baseline properties. The applied current is tiny (typically 0.5 μA or less) and imperceptible to participants.

### Endosomatic Method

The endosomatic method measures naturally occurring electrical potentials within the skin without applying external current. The skin generates its own small voltages (typically a few millivolts) through electrochemical processes in sweat glands and ducts. This method is less common because the signals are smaller and more variable than exosomatic measurements.

Endosomatic measurement yields skin potentials (SP) rather than skin conductance. While SP can provide additional information about sweat gland processes, the exosomatic conductance method is generally preferred for its simplicity, reliability, and easier interpretation.

## Signal Components

### Tonic Level (SCL)

Skin conductance level (SCL) refers to the slow-moving baseline of conductance, measured in microsiemens (μS). SCL changes occur over minutes to hours, reflecting overall arousal state rather than responses to specific stimuli. High SCL indicates elevated sympathetic tone; low SCL indicates a relaxed state.

SCL is influenced by multiple factors: general stress levels, time of day (circadian rhythms affect autonomic tone), ambient temperature and humidity, recent physical activity, and individual differences in baseline arousal. Research studies typically measure SCL during a baseline period before introducing experimental stimuli, then track how SCL changes across conditions.

Typical SCL values range from 2 to 20 μS, though substantial individual variation exists. Some people naturally have more active sweat glands, producing higher baseline conductance. This is why within-subject comparisons are more reliable than between-subject comparisons of absolute values.

### Phasic Responses (SCR)

Skin conductance responses (SCRs) are rapid, transient increases in conductance triggered by specific stimuli or events. An SCR typically begins 1 to 3 seconds after stimulus onset, reaches peak amplitude within 3 to 5 seconds, and returns to baseline over 5 to 10 seconds. These timeframes can vary with stimulus intensity and individual physiology.

SCR amplitude reflects arousal intensity. Larger amplitudes indicate stronger sympathetic activation. However, the relationship between stimulus intensity and SCR amplitude is nonlinear and affected by habituation.

### Habituation

Habituation is the progressive decrease in SCR amplitude with repeated stimulus presentations. If you present the same tone repeatedly, the first presentation produces a large SCR, the second a smaller response, and eventually responses diminish to near-zero. This is normal and reflects sensory adaptation plus cognitive evaluation (the stimulus is no longer novel or significant).

Habituation rate varies across individuals and stimulus types. Novel, significant, or unpredictable stimuli resist habituation better than repetitive, meaningless stimuli. Clinical populations sometimes show abnormal habituation patterns. For example, individuals with anxiety disorders may habituate more slowly, maintaining elevated responses across many trials.

## Recording Procedures

### Electrode Placement

Standard placement sites are the thenar and hypothenar eminences (the fleshy mounds at the base of the thumb and little finger) or the medial phalanges of the index and middle fingers. These sites offer high eccrine gland density, relatively uniform electrical properties, and practical accessibility during experiments.

Electrodes should not be placed on the fingertips (too much movement, uneven pressure) or the palm center (too much variation in contact). The chosen sites should remain still during the recording to prevent movement artifacts.

### Electrode Types and Preparation

Silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes are standard. These provide stable electrical properties and minimize polarization artifacts. Electrodes are filled with an electrolyte gel or paste containing sodium chloride, which improves electrical contact and prevents the electrode itself from acting as an additional resistance.

Skin preparation is minimal for EDA. Unlike EEG (which requires abrasion to reduce impedance), EDA benefits from intact skin. However, the skin should be clean. Washing with mild soap and water, then drying thoroughly, removes oils and debris that might interfere with electrode contact. Alcohol should be avoided because it can dry the skin excessively or irritate sweat glands.

### Environmental Controls

Temperature and humidity significantly affect EDA. Warm environments increase thermoregulatory sweating, elevating baseline SCL. Cold environments reduce sweating. Relative humidity affects evaporation rate, which influences how much sweat accumulates on the skin surface.

Standard practice maintains room temperature at 20 to 24°C with moderate humidity (40 to 60%). Participants should acclimate to the testing room for at least 10 minutes before recording begins. This allows body temperature and sweat gland activity to stabilize.

Physical activity before testing should be controlled. Recent exercise increases thermoregulatory sweating and elevates sympathetic tone. Participants should avoid caffeine and nicotine before testing, as both substances affect sympathetic activity.

### Signal Acquisition

EDA signals are amplified and digitized. Typical sampling rates range from 10 to 100 Hz. While EDA changes slowly compared to EEG or EMG, adequate sampling ensures accurate capture of SCR rise times and peak amplitudes.

Low-pass filtering (typically 1 to 5 Hz) removes high-frequency noise without distorting the SCR waveform. No high-pass filtering is needed because EDA contains substantial low-frequency content (the tonic SCL).

## Data Analysis

### SCL Quantification

SCL is typically averaged across a defined period. Baseline SCL might be calculated as the mean conductance during a 2-minute rest period. Task-related SCL changes are assessed by comparing mean SCL during task blocks to baseline.

Some researchers compute SCL as the minimum conductance value within each time window, reasoning that this represents periods when phasic responses are absent. Others prefer median values to reduce the influence of occasional large phasic responses. The choice depends on research questions and signal characteristics.

### SCR Detection and Quantification

Automated algorithms detect SCRs by identifying conductance increases exceeding a threshold (typically 0.01 to 0.05 μS) within a plausible latency window after stimulus onset. Visual inspection should verify automated detection, as artifacts can produce false positives.

Key SCR parameters include amplitude (peak height above baseline), latency (time from stimulus to response onset), rise time (onset to peak), and recovery time (peak to half-recovery or full recovery). Researchers also quantify SCR frequency (number of responses per minute) and sum of amplitudes across a period.

Non-responders pose a challenge. Some individuals (5 to 10% of the population) produce few or no detectable SCRs despite normal physiology. This is a stable individual characteristic. Non-responders should be identified and either excluded from analyses or analyzed separately.

### Range Correction

Individual differences in SCL create complications for comparing SCR amplitudes across participants. Someone with high baseline SCL may show larger absolute SCR amplitudes simply because their system operates at a higher range. Range correction procedures transform raw amplitudes to account for baseline differences.

The most common approach calculates the natural logarithm of conductance values, which tends to normalize distributions and reduce the correlation between SCL and SCR amplitude. Alternative methods include computing percent change from baseline or using within-subject standardization.

## Interpretation Considerations

### Arousal vs. Valence

EDA reflects arousal intensity but does not distinguish emotional valence (positive vs. negative). A surprising gift and a sudden threat both increase skin conductance. To understand valence, EDA must be combined with other measures: facial expressions, self-report, or physiological signals that differentiate positive and negative states (like facial EMG or EEG asymmetry).

This arousal-only sensitivity is both a limitation and a strength. It limits EDA's ability to characterize specific emotions. But it also means EDA reliably tracks sympathetic activation regardless of the emotional context, making it valuable for studying stress, attention, and cognitive load.

### Specificity to Sympathetic System

Unlike measures like heart rate (influenced by both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems), EDA specifically reflects sympathetic activity. There is no parasympathetic innervation of eccrine sweat glands. This makes EDA an unusually pure index of one branch of the autonomic nervous system.

However, this specificity means EDA cannot tell you about parasympathetic activity or the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. For a complete picture of autonomic function, researchers combine EDA with cardiovascular measures (heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure) that reflect both branches.

## Research Applications

### Emotion Research

EDA has been central to emotion research for decades. Classic studies established that emotional stimuli (frightening images, personal threats, emotionally evocative films) produce larger SCRs than neutral stimuli. The magnitude of SCR correlates with subjectively reported arousal, validating EDA as an arousal measure.

Contemporary research uses EDA to study emotion regulation. When people successfully down-regulate their emotional responses through cognitive strategies (reappraisal, distraction), SCRs decrease. This provides objective evidence that regulation strategies affect physiological arousal, not just subjective experience or behavior.

### Attention and Cognitive Load

SCRs occur to novel, significant, or task-relevant stimuli even when emotion is not obviously involved. The "orienting response" is a classic example: any new or unexpected stimulus produces an SCR reflecting attentional capture. As stimuli become familiar (habituation), orienting responses diminish.

Cognitive load also affects EDA. Difficult mental tasks (complex arithmetic, working memory challenges, decision-making) elevate SCL and trigger SCRs at moments of high processing demand. This makes EDA useful for human factors research examining when interfaces or procedures impose excessive cognitive demands.

### Clinical Assessment

Anxiety disorders show characteristic EDA patterns. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder often have elevated baseline SCL, reflecting chronically heightened sympathetic tone. They may also show larger SCRs to threat-related stimuli and slower habituation.

Phobias produce particularly strong and specific EDA responses. Showing spider images to someone with spider phobia produces dramatically larger SCRs than showing the same images to non-phobic individuals. This stimulus-specific responding forms the basis of exposure therapy, where phobic responses are gradually reduced through repeated, controlled exposure.

Post-traumatic stress disorder involves exaggerated startle responses and heightened reactivity to trauma reminders. EDA captures these physiological features, providing objective markers of symptom severity and treatment response.

### Lie Detection

Polygraph tests rely heavily on EDA, premised on the assumption that lying produces arousal (fear of detection, cognitive effort of deception). During a typical polygraph, examiners ask control questions (known answers, low arousal) and critical questions (related to the investigated event). Larger SCRs to critical questions suggest deception.

However, polygraph accuracy is controversial. Arousal can stem from many sources beyond deception (nervousness about the test itself, fear of false accusation, anger at being suspected). Moreover, some individuals can reduce their responses through countermeasures (muscle tensing, mental distraction) while others naturally produce large responses to all questions.

Despite these limitations, EDA remains a central polygraph component because it is difficult to consciously control and responds reliably to arousal from any source.

### Biofeedback and Therapy

Biofeedback training uses real-time EDA displays to teach arousal self-regulation. Clients watch their skin conductance level on a screen and practice relaxation techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, imagery) while observing the physiological effects. Successful relaxation produces visible SCL decreases, providing immediate reinforcement.

This approach helps treat anxiety, chronic pain, and stress-related conditions. The objective feedback makes the typically invisible process of arousal regulation concrete and trainable. Many clients find it easier to learn relaxation when they can see their physiology responding.

## Advanced Topics

### Wearable EDA Devices

Consumer wearables now incorporate EDA sensors. Wrist-worn devices measure conductance at the wrist (less optimal than palmar sites but acceptable for continuous monitoring). These devices enable ecological momentary assessment, capturing arousal in natural environments rather than laboratories.

Applications include stress monitoring, sleep quality assessment, and seizure prediction (some epileptic seizures produce distinctive autonomic changes detectable via EDA). The technology is still developing, with challenges around motion artifacts, inconsistent contact pressure, and individual calibration.

### Machine Learning Applications

Pattern recognition algorithms applied to EDA signals can classify emotional states, detect stress, and predict behavioral outcomes. Features extracted from SCR waveforms (amplitude, latency, recovery characteristics, frequency patterns) serve as inputs to classification models.

Success depends on substantial training data and careful feature engineering. Some applications achieve reasonable accuracy in controlled settings but struggle with real-world variability. The field is advancing rapidly as larger datasets and more sophisticated algorithms become available.


## Practical Considerations

Standard electrode placements follow established guidelines. Use Ag/AgCl electrodes filled with isotonic electrolyte paste. Maintain room conditions at 20 to 24°C. Allow 10 to 15 minutes acclimation. Record at least 2 minutes baseline before experimental manipulations.

Report recording parameters transparently: electrode type and size, electrode placement sites, electrolyte composition, applied current (for exosomatic), sampling rate, filtering parameters, and analysis procedures. This enables replication and appropriate interpretation.

Individual differences are substantial. Some participants show large, easily detectable responses; others respond minimally. This reflects genuine physiological variability, not measurement error. Use within-subject designs when possible to control for individual differences in baseline reactivity.
